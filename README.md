# 🧠 Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **data structures** written in **C language**.  
Each file demonstrates a different concept used in computer science — focusing on arrays, heaps, queues, and stacks — with clear examples and structured code.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File Name | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `Project_1` | Implementation of basic operations on arrays — insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. |
| `Project_2` | Contains **Queue** (FIFO) and **Stack** (LIFO) implementations using arrays and linked lists. |
| `Project_3` | Code for building **Min-Heaps** and **Max-Heaps**, including insertion, deletion, and heapify algorithms. |

## 🚀 Features

- Clean, modular C code for key data structures  
- Commented explanations for each operation  
- Example test cases for understanding behavior  
- Emphasis on **time complexity** and **memory efficiency**

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Array operations  
- Stack push/pop and overflow handling  
- Queue enqueue/dequeue and circular queue  
- Heap insertion, deletion, and heap sort  
- Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `free`)
